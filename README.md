🌍 Landslide Detection using Hybrid SAM + Swin Transformer

A segmentation-assisted transformer framework for landslide detection in remote sensing imagery.

📌 Overview

Accurate landslide detection from satellite imagery is critical for disaster risk management and hazard mitigation. Traditional CNN-based methods capture local features but struggle with global context, while transformer-based models improve contextual modeling but often lack precise boundary localization.

This project proposes a Segmentation-Guided Swin Transformer Framework, integrating:

Segment Anything Model (SAM) for region-level segmentation

Swin Transformer for hierarchical contextual classification

The goal is to enhance spatial focus, improve boundary delineation, and increase detection robustness.

Key Idea

Instead of using segmentation as a final output, segmentation masks are used as spatial priors to guide transformer-based feature learning.
